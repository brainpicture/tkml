# TKML (Template Kit Markup Language)

TKML isn't just a markup language; it's like your retro '90s game console for web apps! No need for CSS or JSâ€”just plug in your components in XML format and play. We've sprinkled in some '90s vibes and a dash of HTTP/1.1 nostalgia to keep things fun and simple.

TKML is designed for building fast, mobile-friendly web applications with minimal configuration. Think of it as your trusty sidekick, providing a set of pre-styled components that follow modern design principles, so you can focus on creating awesome content without sweating the small stuff.

You can create the simplest TKML app by uploading an `index.tkml` page to your website. This page serves as the entry point for your application. Here's a basic example:

1. **Create an `index.tkml` file**: This file will contain your TKML markup. For instance:

   ```xml
   <title>Hello</title>
   <desc>
       Hello world! This is a minimal TKML website.
   </desc>
   ```

2. **Upload the file to your server**: Place the `index.tkml` file in the root directory of your website or any accessible path.

3. **Access your TKML app**: Go to http://tkml.app, and type `example.com/index.tkml` in input field.

This simple setup will render a page with a title and a description, demonstrating the basic structure of a TKML document.

<html>
<head>
    <title>TKML App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.min.css">
    <script src="./tkml.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="container"></div>
    <script>
        const container = document.getElementById('container');
        const tkml = new TKML(container, { dark: true });
        tkml.load('index.tkml');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
